The E-Bus Ticket Booking Website is a fully responsive online platform designed for users to book eco-friendly electric bus tickets easily. The website includes dedicated pages such as Home, About, Services, Contact, Login, Signup, and Ticket Booking. Users can fill out a booking form with their travel details, and the data is securely stored in a Firebase Realtime Database. An admin can access all stored bookings through a separate admin panel, allowing real-time monitoring of travel records. The front end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while Firebase is used as the backend for data storage. The project demonstrates clean UI design, mobile responsiveness, and integration of cloud-based database services.
